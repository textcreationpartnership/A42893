            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That you came out of the Mine refined gold,

That theſe equally beautifull, and fragrant

that you are not only fair, and flouriſhing, but

when the moſt are either <hi>foul or blaſted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,

for he is <hi>the Nobleſt peer in the World,
that is ſincere religious.</hi> There is no creature

Theſe, theſe my <hi>Lord</hi> are the prerogatives, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,

places, when a Tenant dyes, for the next that
injoies the leaſe of the deceaſed to pay his
Land-lord an Harriot, viz.</hi> The beſt of all
his quick goods, and Cattle. My Fore-fathers
who for an hundred years were Tenants to your
<hi>Lordſhips noble Progenitors,</hi> lye all of them
in their beds of duſt: I ſucceed them in that Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they had to your <hi>Honorable Family.</hi> I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
hope therefore that it will not be interpreted
a breach of Covenants though I pay that ſervice
in lieu of a <hi>Harriot</hi> to your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> which I
confeſſe I doe moſt juſtly owe, and therefore in
Duty, and Gratitude, ought alſo to pay unto that
mirrour, and honour of her Sex, Family, and

yet I dare not tender this Homage to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb facs="tcp:57139:6"/>
without this moſt humble Supplication; That
your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> will be pleaſed to pardon my very
high &amp; criminal preſumption in thus daring to ſetan
orient Jewel in a leaden Ring; to ſtamp your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi>
beautiful image upon a copper medal; and in
offering to pay or rather to acknowledge a little of
my great debt, in leather inſtead of ſilver. But tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
my Lord beſides a faithful heart and fervent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for your felicity, this is the beſt of all my goods,
and the chiefeſt of all my treaſures that I have to lay
at your <hi>Lordſhips feet.</hi> And this is alſo the livelieſt
the trueſt portraiture that I am able to draw: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
of your Honours merits, which to expreſſe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and the moſt eloquent Panegyrick: Or of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Family's favours, Nobleneſs, and Goodneſs
to their Tenants; who did both know and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the faint and ſickly ſweats, the naked
backs, empty bellies, crying wants, complaining
ſufferings, and the inevitable beggery of Tenants
and their Families impoveriſhed, famiſhed, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
by being unmercifully racked in their rents
were both bloudy gain, ſinful providence, cruel
thrift, and alſo a ſure way to canker, and leſſen, yea to
conſume their eſtates. And therefore your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:57139:7"/>
Noble Progenitors ſo far as I do either know

ſhunned, ſcorned, and abhorred thoſe fatal ſhelvs
of oppreſsion, and exaction, upon which ſo many
great, avaritious, worldly greedy Land-lords have
wrack't and ruin'd their eſtates, honour, conſciences,
and poſterities.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this is the exacteſt draught that I can
make of my own thankfulneſſe, and obligations. Be
pleaſed therefore, my moſt <hi>Noble Lord,</hi> once more
I earneſtly beſeech you to pardon both my uncivil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity,
and my unmannerly injurious boldneſſe in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
to beg of your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> not only that you
would condeſcend ſo much below your ſelf as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

you would deign to lodg in ſuch Sheets as are both
very courſe and black. This honour and favour if
your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> will vouchſafe to confer upon me,
then theſe rough-hewn ſtones which I have ſet up as
columns of my faithfulneſse, duty, gratitude, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

are the Forces and weapons wherewith you have, do,

none will or can more cordially honour you then he

                  <head>TO THE
Chriſtian Reader.</head>
                  <p>BOOKS are a Feaſt or Banquet to which the invited
gueſts (all that can read &amp; underſtand) do come with
various appetites and palats. Some do hunger after,
and like beſt, that meat which is moſt unwholeſom
and dangerous, corrupt principles. Others do deſire
and delight chiefly, or only in ſuch dainties and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licates
as are curiouſly cook't and ſerved up either in
the <hi>China-diſhes,</hi> or ſilver plates, of wit and eloquence.
And ſome will feed liberally upon ſuch proviſion as
is both courſe, and common, when it is laid in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury
ſauce of truth. The firſt of theſe I would not
entertain if I could, <hi>procul hinc, procul ite;</hi> for I
have neither a bit nor a drop for you, unleſſe like
ſpiders you will ſuck poyſon out of ſweet flowers. The
ſecond I cannot though I would; For I have no rare
or generous wines (no Rhetorical ſtreams flowing
from the pure and limpid fountain of raviſhing Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory)
to invite, tempt, or delightfully to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I the Mine of a rich invention, or the neceſſary Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
of a lofty towring fancy, either to furniſh and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
my Table with ſweet meats, or to confine you
<pb facs="tcp:57139:9"/>
within the circle of Approbation. My pen cannot drop
Nectar, or life-honey, nor are my lines either ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with pearl and Jewels, choiſe and refined con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits;
or enamelled with elegant, indearing, melting
phraſes. Only the laſt ſort then, are my (yea and their
own) true friends. They are heartily welcome to my
poor dinner of green herbs. If any thing pleaſe them
I deſire them to eat freely, &amp; much good may it
do them. But as for them (and God knows there are
too many ſuch nominall Chriſtians in the world) that,
like thoſe who are ſurfeited, ſickly, breeding, or dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
do nauſeate and abhor almoſt every thing, and
uſually thoſe things moſt that are moſt nouriſhing, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
ſafe, and proper for them, that will ſcarce
touch, taſt or ſip of the beſt potion or Pharmacon
to ſave their lives; I do adviſe them either to change
their minds, or to forbear my table; becauſe truth
and holy Counſells will (like Phyſick) either help or
hurt, cure or kill them. I have run and ruſhed I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
into that crowd, which doth not only preſſe and
oppreſſe the preſſe, but ſurfeit it too: Otherwiſe ſuch
filthy, unſavory, loathſome, impoſtumated matter,

may too frequently behold. I know verie well alſo,
that this is a quaint, a queaſie, a criticall, a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive,
and a peeviſh Age. I ſhall therefore that I
may not offend it more; (it being alreadie too apt to
be angry with truth and plaineſſe) and in order to
the ſatisfying of ſuch whoſe reaſon is not in their wils,
whoſe heaven is not in their Luſts, whoſe brains are

                  <p>Firſt then negatively; It is not, Reader, I aſſure thee
a tympanied ambition to be known to the world; For
he is certainly very ſtrangely diſtempered in his head
that will knowingly and deliberately make, and ſet up

is't the midwifery of others importunity (that <hi>Hackney,</hi>
bald, thred-bare, lean, and wondrous old apology
for printing, and common pimp to the preſſe) that
hath delivered me of theſe little, weak, and ſcarce
breathing children: Nor is it either the wealth or beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of theſe ſiſters (unleſſe you will be ſo kind as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
them fair and rich becauſe they are neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
nor diſeaſed) that hath prevailed with me to
offer them unto the love, acceptance, and imbraces of
the world. Nor is it levity of mind, or a laſcivious
Genius that makes me proſtitute them to the eys and
hands of all. Nor are a deſire of praiſe from the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,

theſe helpleſſe infants will find either civility, curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
or charity abroad, ſince the moſt are friends only to
the wealthy, but <hi>Momus's</hi> and <hi>Nabals</hi> to books and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
Nor yet is it becauſe I am perſwaded that others
have not done much better then my ſelf herein; For I
well know, and freely confeſſe my ſelf to be but a dwarf
to thoſe Gyants, a mole-hill to thoſe mountains, and
but a little winking candle compared with thoſe great
and bright Sun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of learning, by whoſe poliſhed, exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
ſtructures, theſe my unhewen ſtones are ſet up. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively,
or poſitively then my reaſons and end why
I ſuffered theſe doves to fly abroad are theſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe as our Talents (though but few or little)
muſt not be profuſely waſted; ſo neither muſt they be
parſimoniouſly buried in the napkins either of idleneſs
or ſilence.</p>
                  <p>2. Secondly, becauſe it's both my prayer and hope,
that with ſome of theſe ſmooth ſtones taken out of that
cryſtal brook the holy Scriptures, put into, and thrown
out of the ſling of truth though by a little, weak aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
that great, dangerous, miſchievous, deadly, and

bleſſing, and aſſiſtance of Gods omnipotent arm, who
can when, and where it pleaſeth him give both birth
and ſucceſſe to this deſign and encounter) will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
in ſome of thoſe that ſhall ſeriouſly and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
peruſe my papers: And alſo that thoſe uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
<hi>Philiſtins</hi> (honour, pleaſure, profit) which have
manacled the hands and put out the eyes of ſo many
<hi>Samſons</hi> (chained, corrupted, yea deaded the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and blinded the minds of ſo many millions of men
<pb facs="tcp:57139:10"/>
and women) will be either vanquiſhed or weakened,
in them.</p>
                  <p>3. Thirdly, becauſe though the thin web of my work
be through an unskilful hand very courſe ſpun, yet
ſince the warp is truth, and the oufe profit, I do not
deſpair but it may, yea will, not only invite but alſo
delight and benefit, ſome of my chapmen, my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
ſince I know that there are many both ſo inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>ous,
and ſo ingenuous, that I am perſwaded a Cord
twiſted and made up of Divinity, Reaſon, Experience,
and Hiſtory will both hold them, pleaſe them, and
become not only an acceptable, but an amiable orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto them, although the workman want both
art, and elegancy.</p>
                  <p>4. Fourthly, becauſe though I am very far from
preſuming, or pretending to be fit or able either to
teach thoſe ſcholars that are deſervedly preferred into
the upper School: Or to add any light of knowledg
to thoſe bright ſtars in the high O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bs of Learning: yet
I hope I may without offence, yea and with ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to them alſo, immind, and intreat them, to
joine ſcience and conſcience together, to live up to
their knowledge and duty, by burning inwardly with
a well-grounded, well-guided zeal for God; and by ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
outwardly towards men with ſobriety, innocency,
ſanctity; Since great gifts, parts and abilities with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
honeſty and grace, are great ſnares, temptations,
miſchiefs, and plagues both to themſelves and others.
And ſince without a holy, diligent, careful improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them both to Gods glory and the good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
all thoſe whom God hath honoured and enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with them, will by him be greatly and grievouſly
<pb facs="tcp:57139:11"/>
puniſhed for abuſing, or not uſing and imploying of
them. And as for thoſe who are yet in the petty
ſchool, and lower forms, that have not overgrown,
nor travailed beyond their <hi>A. B. C.</hi> in underſtanding
and religion, nor as yet rightly learned to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſin, the world, or their Chriſts croſſe (that
great work, duty, and comfort of true Chriſtians)
there are leſſens offered and ſet by me very neceſſary
for them to be acquainted with, inſtructed in, immin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of, and ſeaſoned withall.</p>
                  <p>5. Laſtly becauſe I know that although many, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of accepting my poor indeavours, and receiving
the truth in the love of it, will not only reject, and
diſregard it, but alſo cenſure, yea bite, and revile the
Author with their invenomed teeth, and frothy, filthy
tongues; yet my labour will not, ſhall not be in
vain, becauſe it's in the Lord, and for the Lord. In his
name and fear this plain (not moſaick or carved) work
was undertaken, to his glory it was, and is intended,
directed, and by his aſſiſtance, it is finiſhed; I do not,
I dare not ſay, perfected. His bleſſing, his powerful,
gracious, fruitful influence, I do therefore moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beg upon it. And do only deſire theſe few very
reaſonable things and favours of my Readers:</p>
                  <p>Firſt that they would inſtead of carping, ſnarling,
or barking at my book, which I confeſſe hath too much
Alloy and droſſe (but no poiſon) in it, communicate
their own more pure, and better refined labours to the
world. It will be, I aſſure them, my joy and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not envy or ſorrow, to ſee, and their own, not

                     </gap>'d Cottages,
as mine is are erected.</p>
                  <p>2. Secondly, that they would prize, welcome, and
imbrace truth, though it curb, croſſe, or kill their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Joies, profane waies, and worldly intereſts.</p>
                  <p>3. Thirdly, That they would ſeriouſly conſider that
Jewels are both as precious and reſplendent in a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
box, or in an earthen pot, as in a cabinet of Pearl:
That there may be uſefull, wholeſome, and ſavoury
herbs in that Garden, which wants the bravery, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
glories, and the gaudey embroidery of curious
flowers; And that ſweet meats may do well for ſauce,
or to taſte of, but are not fit, or ſafe to be made our
daily bread.</p>
                  <p>4 Fourthly, that they would not be their own mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
and Executioners by loving vice, and hating
vertue, by adoring earth, and trampling Heaven un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their feet, by forſaking Chriſt, to follow the
world, by poiſoning their ſouls, to pleaſe their ſenſes,
by deferring their repentance, and an holy Life till
death; or by leaving the ſafe and pleaſant ways of truth
and righteouſneſſe, to walk in the dangerous, deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
paths of error, hereſies, and wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>5. Laſtly, I do earneſtly intreat them to read what
I have written without partiality, paſſion, prejudice,
and prepoſſeſſion, that Maxim being moſt true here;
<hi>Intus exiſtens, prohibet altenum.</hi> For, veſſels top full
of earth cannot receive without being emptied either
gold or gemms: And the moſt precious cordial, the
moſt ſoveraign <hi>Julep</hi> muſt needs be loſt, and ſpilt, if
it be put into a diſh that is brim-ful of dung, or muck-hill-pit
water; Read them then (once more I do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately,

pray and requeſt you) with hearts wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
deſirous and reſolved to be informed, immin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
convinced, reformed, confirmed, and if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any good by my weak labours, remember to give
God the glory of his own work and mercy; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of your praiſes Crown me with your prayers. But
if you do not profit by them conſider, That bad, diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
and diſtempered ſtomacks do turn the beſt meats

upon the conſideration of Country Gentlemen ſemblable to the three
Regions of the Air. In the middle, Clouds and Vapours and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors
apt to condenſe into plagues; or drie and fiery Exhalations which
unreſtrain'd by providence divine, fall down in oppreſſions, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences.
Among theſe we may rank divers of our dull Grands, who

or Cathedrall leaſes, or later eaſier purchaſes; like Muſhrooms, or
Fuzzes of noiſome earth, grow able to dimme both learned Witts and
nobler Originalls.</p>
                  <p>In a lower Region, we diſcern ſome, that having contented themſelves
for a dozen months to wear a gaudy gown in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, and only
to play with a few books finely ſtrung and guilded, return with that
Library, whence ſtreams of learning flow up to their lips, and cluſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of choiſe ſentences hang dangling ore their beds and ſhelves, while
they like <hi>Tantalus,</hi> ſo ſet, cannot ſip, nor reach what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

prey of Sycophants, or crafty Servants, and their Souls hardly eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

they dare not leap that pale out of which they are made to believe, that
God hath no Dear, nor they any hope of Salvation.</p>

ceaſing further to trouble thee, to preſent a Letter of Requeſt for a
new favour unto thee; I mean, to entreat thy pardon of the following
Errata's, which being both many, and great ones, do ſtand in need at
once of thy curteſy and ingenuity to correct and excuſe them. Beſides, the
Book being tranſcribed by one that did neither obſerve the Orthography,
nor regard the Comma's, Semicolons, Colons, or Periods of ſentences, they
do in too many places of it both requeſt thy Candor, and want thy care to
rectifie them. Its my unhappineſſe and not fault, that this trouble ſhould
be given thee. I hope therefore thou wilt not condemn the Author, but
paſs by, or amend in thy Reading the faults in tranſcribing and printing
of them. This favour if thou pleaſeſt to grant, it will double his obligations
to love and thank hee, who both deſires thy ſpiritual good, and to do thee
good ſpiritually.</p>

                     <p>HEE is truly, really, both God and man; God, that
he might ſatisfie the Lords juſtice, appeaſe his wrath,
juſtifie and acquit guilty, condemned man;<note n="*" place="margin">Propter homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem homo Deus factus eſt.</note> man that he
might die for ſin, purchaſe life for thoſe who were ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
dead, and redeem them both from their woful ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and from eternall miſery. He put off thoſe Royall
robes of Majeſty and Glory, and put on (in his Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
the courſe, rotten Garments, or rather rags of fleſh
and frailty, and ſo became like us in all things ſin only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
Behold here infinite, aſtoniſhing, miraculous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement,
Compaſſion, Condeſcenſion. The Creator of
the world became a mortall man, the King of Kings a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
Man ſins, and his God willingly dies to expiate his
Crimes. The Actions and paſſion of this bleſſed Jeſus
are a continued ſeries of miracles, a golden chain let down
from heaven to earth, all whoſe links are love, mercy,
goodneſſe, pity, wonder.<note n="a" place="margin">Dio Caſſius.</note>

But this, and ten thouſand times more, Compaſſion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
charity, is not ſo much as a drop to the Ocean,
a beam of light to the Sun, or a duſt in the ballance to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57139:21"/>
the whole earth, compared with the love of Chriſt to undone
man. For never did the moſt tender hearted Soveraign do
that for a wounded Souldier; nor yet the moſt faithful lover
for his deareſt friend, which Jeſus Chriſt did for his deadly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
enemies. What Prince did ever give his Throne, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to his chiefeſt Rebells? What Phyſitian did ever let
the bloud out of his own heart to cure a moſt malitious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull
Patient? What Judge did ever freely ſacrifice his
own life to ſave a condemned malefactor, who did not only
deſire and reſolve, but indeavour to murther him upon the
Bench? What Generall or Commander did ever ſuffer wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
himſelf to be mortally wounded, to cure the hurts or
ſave the lives of thoſe Souldiers who conſpired to betray
him? Yet Jeſus Chriſt did all this and infinitely more; for
he left heaven, deſcended out of the Chariot and came down
from the Throne of his Glory, to ſit upon his foot-ſtool
the earth. He willingly indured a cloſe impriſonment in
that dark Dungeon, the womb of his both Mother and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for a time; and afterwards he removed himſelf into
that greater Gaole the world, into which he was no ſooner
entred by his birth, but diſregard, diſhonor, contempt, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
attended on him, ſaluted him, and was the beſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
the chief Rent, and Homage which his Tenants,
Subjects, Creatures afforded, preſented, paid unto him their
Lord, King, Creator. Immediately, yea conſtantly after
this cold, uncivil, unkind, ingrateful uſage till his death,
bloudy enemies hunted this Royal Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
to deſtroy him; cruell Eagles purſued this harmleſſe, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Dove, to prey upon him; Malitious cunning Foxes
attempted to catch this innocent meek Lamb of God, whom
they ſhould have worſhipped to worrey him: ſome openly
perſecuted, others ſecretly combined againſt him; ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
affronted, others ſubtilly by queſtions, varniſhed
with Religion, and gilded with pretence of conſcience la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to inſnare him: ſome ſcorned and derided, others
blaſphemed him: This golden Ball was continually bandied
and toſſed up and down in the Tennis Court of this world
by wicked men with the Rackets of Implacable malice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged

ignorance, blind ambition, and barbarous perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
till he was ſtricken into the hazzard of his Grave by the
hand of death. And yet all this was kindneſſe, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to thoſe injuries, to that Tragedie, which he received,
and ſoone after acted: for they conſulted, apprehended, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed,
buffeted, derided, reviled, undervalued, inſulted, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
crowned with thornes (at once to mock and wound
him) arraigned, condemned, and then crucifi'd him. And
yet all this too was love, eaſe, pleaſure, mercy, to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable,
yea unconceivable miſery which their own, and the
ſins of the whole world burthened, and afflicted him withall
in that bloudy, violent, terrible conflict of his upon the croſs

                     <p>5. And laſtly, that the obdurate, &amp; ſtony heart of ſinful man
muſt be rent and broken by true repentance, humiliation
and contrition, before he can have any ſaving intereſt in, or

                        <p>MOST deare and yet moſt dreadful Jeſus, who art a God of
might and Majeſty as well as mercy of juſtice as we as pity,
a Lyon as well as a Lamb, a Saviour and a Soveraign, and at once
the Creator, Husband, Brother and Redeemer of thine Elect: Be
pleaſed bleſſed Jeſus to grant that thoſe who own thine own name, wear
thy Livery, and have Covenanted with thee to be thy Servants may
be careful, watchful, zealous, conſcientious and willing to honour their
Maſter thy ſacred and moſt excellent Majeſty, to obey thy commands, to
imitate thy holy Life, and to accept thee on thine own terms joyfully,
thankfully, heartily, even as a Lord, King, Prophet, to govern, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
teach them, as well as a Prieſt and Saviour to ſacrifice and die
for them. Let them conſider what it will coſt them to buy this precious
field, this ineſtimable jewel; what they muſt do to be real Chriſtians,
and to get a ſaving Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt. That they muſt ſell all
that they have, part readily and reſolvedly with the World, with
their ſins, their Iſaacs, Idols yea their Lands, Liberties and Lives
alſo, if he who is the Lord and giver of them require us to ſurrender them
to and for his own uſe and glory. That they muſt take Chriſt as in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial
Covenant, and be not only chaſt, obedient pleaſing, faithful,
constant to him, but alſo that they muſt honour and eſteem him above
all other things, admit no corrival into their affection with him, rejoyce
in his preſence, mourn for his abſence, grieve when he's offended by
them, and angry with them, forſake all for him, cleave ſtedfaſtly to
him, and neither for either love of life, or fear of death, leave, diſhonour,
or deny him. That they muſt be mortify'd, Self-denying, ſincere Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
That they muſt not expect to be carryed on Beds of Down, or to
have their way green, ſmooth, eaſy, ſoft, or ſtrawed with flowers to
Heaven. That they muſt run without fainting, loytering or tyring
to the end of the Race if they would obtain the prize. That they muſt
cheerfully, couragiouſly bear Christs croſſe, or elſe they ſhall never tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly
wear a Crown. That they muſt not only ſweep, ſweeten,
cleanſe, and open the duſty, dirty-filthy, ſin-lockt houſes of their hearts

of the Table in the higheſt ſeat, esteem, affect him above and beyond all
other perſons or things whileſt they live on earth, or elſe when they die
he will never open the narrow Gate of Life to let them into Heaven.
That if they be not good and holy in the Kingdome of Grace, they ſhall
never be great or happy in the Kingdome of Glory. That if their ſins and
luſts which Lord it over them revel in them, captivate them, and are
dear and ſweet unto them, be not hated, crucified and forſaken by them,
the Lord Jeſus Chriſt though he was crucified for ſinners and died to
purchaſe Life for tranſgreſſors who were ſpiritually dead, will never ſave
them. That therefore we may reſolve and labour to get into that Arke
Jeſus Chriſt, where ſafety and ſalvation only are to be found; make us,
I beſeech thee, ſpeedingly really, ſavingly ſenſible of the want, the worth,
the excellency, All-ſufficiency and the neceſſity of a Jeſus, that ſo
we may court, ſeek, and value thee, in and from whom alone is all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſweetneſſe, happineſſe above all things. And let, O moſt gracious
God, all our ſins be laid upon the Head, ſet upon the Account of that
Scape-goat Jeſus Christ, that ſo they may be carried into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of forgetfulneſſe. Take away, O Lord, our filthy Garments from us,
and clothe us with change of Raiment; impute the Righteouſneſſe of
Jeſus Chriſt to us, that ſo being found in the Garments of our elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we may receive from our heavenly Father the Bleſſing of Grace
here, and that wherewith thou crowneſt thy own freely given, and yet by
Chriſt dearly purchaſed Grace, eternal Glory hereafter. Grant this O
Lord for his ſake who died to ſatisfie thy dreadfull Juſtice, who ſhed his
heart-bloud to quench the fire of thy flaming conſuming wrath, to pay
our debts, to purchaſe our pardon, to redeem us from eternall ſlavery
and miſery, and to ſave, our undone Souls. <hi>Amen.</hi>

proceeding from both the Father and the Son, and yet Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſentiall,
Coeternall, and Coequal with them. The <hi>opera &amp;
officia,</hi> the works and Offices of the Holy Ghoſt, are theſe.</p>
                     <p>1. It illuminates our blind underſtandings, and teacheth
us to know what we are by nature, together with the ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſity
and felicity of being born again. It teacheth us alſo
to know the danger, deformity, and miſery of ſin, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
and undeſerved love of God and Chriſt to undone man,
and the means both to eſcape eternal death, and to obtain
immortal glory.</p>
                     <p>2. It regenerates us, making us that were profane, holy;
barren, fruitfull; rebellious, Loyall; and impenitent, truly
ſorrowfull for all our tranſgreſſions.</p>
                     <p>3. It quickens, and breatheth Life into us, that were by
nature dead, and buried in treſpaſſes and ſins.</p>
                     <p>4. It both inſpires and ſtirreth up good motions in our

Fire firſt heats, 2. ſhines, 3. aſcends, 4. ſoftens, and 5. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
droſſy and hard things: ſo the Holy Ghoſt, 1. inflames
our frozen hearts with love to God, and zeale for God.
2 It makes Chriſtians ſhine in works of piety, juſtice, charity,
mercy, and in holineſſe of life. 3. It raiſeth their naturally
low-flying, or rather crawling affections from earthly things,
and maketh them to mount, and fix them upon God, Chriſt,
and heavenly things. 4. It turneth a heart of Adamant into
a ſoft and tender heart of fleſh. 5. It purgeth away a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
droſſe, it purifies him from his corruptions and filth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Holy Ghoſt is compared to<note n="e" place="margin">Ezech. 36. 25.</note> water; for as
water, 1. refreſhes, 2. quenches, 3 cleanſes, 4. fructifies: So
the Spirit of God, comforts, cheares, and reviveth troubled,
weary, languiſhing hearts. 2. It quencheth Gods fiery wrath,
kindled and flaming out againſt tranſgreſſors in their terrors,
ſpiritual deſertion, trouble, &amp; anguiſh of ſoul and conſcience
for their ſins. 3 It cleanſeth them from all filthineſs both
of fleſh &amp; ſpirit. 4. It makes them fruitful in every good work.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Holy Ghoſt is compared to a<note n="*" place="margin">John 3. 32.</note> Dove: As Doves
are 1. meek, for they have no gall; 2. innocent and harmleſſe
creatures; 3. Lovers of, and delighted with white houſes to

that have the ſpirit of God are, 1. free from malice,
hatred, ſinfull anger, envy, or however they mourn, and are
exceedingly diſpleaſed with themſelves for being otherwiſe.
2. The Holy Ghoſt makes them not only carefull to do
no hurt or wrong to any, but alſo willing and deſirous to
do good unto others, eſpecially ſpiritually, that is to their
ſoules. 3. It makes their hearts pure and white by ſprinkling
the bloud of Chriſt upon them, and working godly ſorrow
in them, without which it will neither delight nor dwell in
them, becauſe ſin unrepented of, makes the ſoul black, ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and filthy.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the holy Ghoſt is compared to<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 2. 3.</note> cloven fiery
tongu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s, to teach us that our tongues muſt be cloven with
Charity and fervency in our prayers: for 1. we muſt not
only beg earneſtly for mercy, but we muſt alſo praiſe the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57139:27"/>
Lord moſt heartily for his mercies; petition and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
muſt cleave them. 2. We muſt pray for both ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and temporall mercies, theſe, muſt again divide our
tongues. 3. We muſt pray and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ry mightily not only for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of ſin, for the removal, or ſanctification of afflictions,
for grace and proſperity, to and for our ſelves, but for
all others alſo. 4. We muſt pray not only that God would
give us and others glory hereafter, but alſo that we and
they may honour and glorifie God here. And certainly all
thoſe that have this glorious Spirit, have alſo not only
their tongues, but their hearts too, thus cloven: with zeal,
I mean for God, and love to their own and others ſouls.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, the Holy Ghoſt is compared to a<note n="*" place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 13.</note> Seal, becauſe
as Deeds and Conveyances are unable and ineffectual
to ſettle, and aſſure thoſe things conteined in them, being
null and voyd in Law, till they be fealed: So we can have
no ſound, good, or clear Evidences, that our ſins are forgiven
us, that God is reconciled to us, that the Lord Jeſus is our
Jeſus, and that our ſouls ſhall be ſaved, till we be ſealed by
the Spirit of God.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, the Holy Ghoſt is compared to<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 1 22, and ch 4. v. 5.</note> Earneſt; for as
Earneſt is an argument and proof of an agreement betwixt
man and man, for ſomething to be delivered and given by
one to another; and alſo an aſſurance that ſome other and
greater thing ſhall be made good, and received, when that
is given and taken: So by having the Earneſt of the Spirit
Chriſtians are aſſured that now the Lord and they are agreed
and reconciled, that they ſhall undoubtedly have his favour,
bleſſing, grace here, and that they ſhall hereafter injoy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
joy, and bliſſe with him for ever.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, the Holy Ghoſt is compared to<note n="†" place="margin">John 16. 13.</note> a Guide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
as Guides do, 1. Comfort, 2. direct, 3 defend, 4. keep
thoſe they travail with, from wandring, 5. accompany them
and bring them to their Journeys end: So the ſpirit of God
doth 1. wonderfully ſolace and rejoyce the hearts of tru Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in their pilgrimage on earth. 2. It directs and ſheweth
them which is the ſure good, and beſt way for them to go in.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:57139:28"/>
3. It ſecures and delivers them from thoſe enemies and
dangers that lye in Ambuſh to ſurprize them, and are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to ſeize upon them. 4. It keeps them from erring and
ſtraying in the broad, dangerous, yea deadly ways of ſin, and
leads them forward in the narrow, but ſafe and happy path
of life.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, the Holy Ghoſt never leaves them finally, but
conducts them with ſafety, joy, and comfort to their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
longed for, and deſired home, Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Theſe and ſuch like are the bright, beautiful, and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Beams, that ray from his glorious Sun, and dart conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
exultation peace, and felicity into the hearts of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Theſe are the pure, reviving and pleaſant ſtreams that flow
from this Fountain, or rather Ocean, into the fouls of true
Chriſtians. Theſe are the radiant, rich, yea precious and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable
Jewels that embelliſh and adorn the Holy Spirits
Manſion, a truely Gracious heart. Let us then ſincerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
fervently beg, highly prize this Holy Spirit, and
when ever it knocks at the door of our hearts by any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
motions, ſay as<note n="†" place="margin">Geneſ. 24. 31.</note>

they have given him the flowr of their youth, God will never
accept the bran of their age; that the day of Grace is ended, and
the door of mercy ſhut, &amp; therefore it is in vain either to work
or knock; that their ſins have made them like ſtubble fully
dry, &amp; therefore God wil be a conſuming fire to them; that they
have walked ſo far, and ſo long in the broad way of death,
that it's now too late to turn into the narrow way of life;
that their iniquities have made them too filthy, for Gods
pure eyes to pity them; that they have turned a deaf care to
their Makers commands, and therefore he will not now hear
their cries; that they have both lockt and bolted the iron

of his hatred againſt Rebellion in <hi>England,</hi> I ſhall therefore
(though I intended to add no more) briefly mention them.
The one is his mercifull blaſting the hopes of thoſe perſons
commonly called the fly-blown, ſtinking Rump. The other
is his ſeaſonable breaking the horns of thoſe Phanaticks in
the North. This is the Lords doing, and it is marvailous
in our eyes. And thus we ſee again, that though God may
for a time forbear to puniſh Rebellion, yet he will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
it. Though the juſt Laws of men may ſleep, or rather ſeem
to ſlumber a while, yet they will both ſurely and quickly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken:
And though they may be gagged or bound by the
cruell hands of Violence and Treaſon, yet they will moſt

terror, unpitied deſtruction, and the joyfull

we diſtribute them, the more abundantly we encreaſe
them. They are leſſened by keeping, and multiplied by
leſſening of them; they are gotten by giving them away,
heaped together by diſperſing, and retained by beſtowing of
them. If we ſpare them, we conſume them; if we
hide them, we loſe them, but if we releive others with them,
we ſave them: They will not ſtay long with us if we keep
them only to our ſelves; they will never be more truly ours,
then when we freely communicate them to others.

If then we would be wealthy, we muſt be liberall, ſince the
way to be beggerly is to be niggardly, and to be poor to
be parſimonious. The ſafeſt place to keep our Riches in, is
Chriſts treaſury, the poor. When <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great had
given away his Treaſure, and they aſked him where it was,
he pointed to the poor, and ſaid <hi>in Scriniis,</hi> in my Cheſts And
the only way to take our wealth with us to Heaven, or to

Money is a good Maid, but a bad Miſtreſs. If we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

they will deceive us; They will ſerve a wordly wicked man:

of affliction, yea in the darkeſt dungeon of tentation
or deſertion, ſmiling upon him in the moſt amiable face of
Jeſus Chriſt. 'Tis the wing that carries Prayer to the Throne
of grace, and the uſher that leads the ſoul home (to Heaven)
and there leaves it. 'Tis a <hi>Peter</hi> catching hold of Chriſt, when
ready to ſink in a Sea of perplexitie. It's a Sun that may be
miſted with fears, and darkned with doubtings, but can
never be totally or finally eclipſed by deſpair; for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
may loſe his feeling, but it's impoſſible for him to
loſe his<note n="*" place="margin">Joſuah 1. 5. compared with Hebr. 13. 15.</note> union: He may indeed want for a time the luſtre,
but he cannot for ever be deprived of the light of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.
Like a tree in winter he may ſeem to others, yea and
to himſelf too to be dead, yet even then his root is full of
ſap and alive, his heart hath ſaving grace in it, for his life is
hid in Chriſt: he hath an immortall ſeed in him which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
periſh though (like fire under aſhes) it may be couered,
and for a time not diſcerned, either to grow, or burn; and
therefore he will certainly (like<note n="*" place="margin">Pſalm. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Davids</hi> tree) be both green,
well liking, and fruitful again. Theſe being truths to me like
the Sun-beams when most radiant, equally clear and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
1. That where true and ſaving grace is once wrought in
the heart by the ſpirit of God, it may indeed decay, but is
cannot die. (For this Lamp will alwaies be fed with that
Oyl from Heaven) it may be hidden, but it ſhal not be loſt,
it may be wounded, but it cannot be killed: For though
ſin may blurre, and fully a Chriſtians evidences, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
cancell them, nor ſhall it ever pull off that ſeal which
the holy Spirit hath ſet unto them and ſtampt upon them.</p>
                     <p>2. That those whom God once loves with his peculiar, his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57139:53"/>
ſpeciall love, ſhal never become the eternal objects of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and wrath. Becauſe whom God once loves, loves he<note n="*" place="margin">John. 13. 1.</note>
ſaith Saint <hi>John,</hi> to the end, that is for ever.</p>
                     <p>3. And that none of thoſe who by a juſtifying faith are
eſpouſed to Jeſus Chriſt, (though they may provoke him to
frown, chide, threaten, yea puniſh them) ſhall ever have a
Bill of divorce given unto them by him. Becauſe all ſuch
(though they be not ſo ſanctifyed as to have no roots that
bear Gall, and the bitter fruits of ſin in them, nor ſo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
as to have no filth, ſtains, or ſoil adhere in this world
unto them) are fully acquitted of, and diſcharged from that
infinite debt they owed unto God by their Al-ſufficient ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Jeſus Chriſt who paid it for them, ſo that it will never be
required of them. And although they be not perfectly, yet
they are ſincerely pure and holy here, and therefore ſhal moſt
certainly be ſaved hereafter. Saving faith, 'tis the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt

the Apoplexy of ſecurity, and the beſt <hi>Aqua Coeleſtis,</hi> the beſt

for our ſins, more then for our ſufferings, and that

(it being double dyed, and twice dead in Originall, and
in actuall ſin, and pluckt up by the roots through delight
and continuance therein) in the rich ſoil of Grace, and a

Jeſus Chriſt (as <hi>Hortenſius</hi> did his Plane trees with wine, (if

of that Obligation, without the performance whereof the
Soul cannot be diſcharged from the debt of ſin, but remains
lyable every moment to be arreſted (without all poſſibility
of either flying, hiding, or defending it ſelf) by that irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable,

'Tis that Aqua fortis which both eats through the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

vertue, piety, are engraven upon the inward man. 'Tis the
water which both quenches the burning wrath of God,

a cloudy wet morning, but a bright, fair, pleaſant afternoon,
and a glorious Sun-ſet follows it. 'Tis one of a Chriſtians
main deeds, and beſt evidences for his right and title to an
heavenly inheritance. The Motto of a true penitent may
well be (like that <hi>French</hi> Ladies) a watering pot dropping
with this inſcription, <hi>Nil mihi praeterea, praeterea mihi nihil.</hi>
He's happier weeping then the wicked are when rejoycing;
for there is more true delight, and joy of heart in the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of Saints, then in the mirth and laughter of the world.
<hi>Verus poenitens de peccatis dolet &amp; de dolore gaudet.</hi> A true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
grieves for his ſins, and rejoyceth in that grief, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The <hi>Athenians</hi> never went to conclude a peace, but in mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
habits; we can never make our peace with God, unleſs
we go to him with mourning hearts. True repentance doth
work wonders. It will turn a Wolf into a Lamb, an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle

thee, which are preſented, and tendered with Water, with penitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

'Tis the<note n="*" place="margin">Cantic. 4. 16. and 7. 5.</note> Garden, the Gallery, where Chriſt mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
ſpeaks to, and walks with his people. 'Tis the mount
of bleſſings, conduit of faith, Golden Scepter of mercy, and
the ſpirituall ſeed of Grace and Life. 'Tis the Chariot in
which Chriſt rideth triumphantly into the Soul. 'Tis the
hammer that breaks open the iron door of the heart, the
key that unlocks it. Tis the fire that conſumeth all Satans
ſtrong holds in the ſpirit. 'Tis ſpirituall eye-ſalve, that
gives a blind <hi>Bartimeus</hi> his ſight. And 'tis the voice that awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens

haſt commanded the Goſpell of Salvation to be preached to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
both to Jews and Gentiles. Yet ſince even this word of Life

the Holy Ghoſt may both teach and ſpeak effectually, convincingly,
convertingly, ſavingly to the ears and hearts of unregenerated Sinners,

of God, and live. And be thou pleaſed moſt merciful God ſo to own,

graciouſly changed, their Lives throughly reformed, and their ſouls

                     <p>IT is the ſeed-time both of Grace and Glory. 'Tis a ſhort,
craggy, thorny, narrow way, to a ſad, or joyfull, to a
bleſſed, or curſed eternity. 'Tis a tree from which ſome
blooms doe fall in their infancy, on which ſome buds are
blaſted when but juſt ſet in their child-hood, from which
ſome green fruits are ſnatched off in their youth, upon
which ſome hang till Manhood, and then are violently
ſtricken down, or pulled off by the hand of death; and
ſome continue thereon, untill they be full ripe by old age,
and then drop down into their graves. Man hath as it were
two Sepulchres; One in the warm belly of his naturall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the other in the cold Bowels of the common Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of all both men and women, the Earth. By life he is put
into a Gaole, by Death into a Dungeon. So ſoon as we
are born we cry; as if becauſe we then want language to
ſpeak them, our eyes did weep elegies, and by thoſe tears at
once prognoſticate, expreſſe, and lament our future trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
ſorrowes, ſufferings, Funerals. The <hi>Mexicanes</hi> thus
ſalute their Infants coming out of the Womb: Infant
thou art come into the World to ſuffer, endure; ſuffer and
hold thy peace. Our Mothers are living Tombs to us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our birth; and ſo ſoon as ever we do but peep, or
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57139:89"/>
ſtep into the world, every thing not only mindeth us
of, but alſo preacheth and readeth Sermons, Lectures, and
Leſſons to us of our departure out of it again. For what
are our ſwadling cloaths, but winding ſheets? What are our
cradles, but Coffins? What is the ringing of the Bell before
our being Chriſtened, but an antedated paſſing peal? What
are thoſe arms which carry us to Church to be baptized,
but a Biere? What doth our being firſt undreſt ſignifie, but
the putting off of our mortality? What is our being layd
down to ſleep, but an embleme of our Buriall? And what is
our firſt ſleep, but the Image and elder Brother of Death? Life
'tis a weak twig, and a ſlender thread upon which fraile man
hangeth over both his Grave, and Hell. 'Tis a Tragae-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie

of Death with ſighs, ſadneſſe, unwillingneſſe. The thread
of Life is ſo ſhort and rotten, that it is often (yea alas too
often) ſpun out by the wheele and broken off by the hand
of providence, before it leads us out of the Labyrinths and
maze of ſin and miſery; many millions being carryed to
their graves, before they conſider why, or for what they
came out of the Womb into the world. For they do not
conſider that Man was not made and born to imbaſe his Soul
with the allay of ſin, which alone renders it capable and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it fit to receive the impreſſions of temptations and all
reall evills. To fewell and feed his filthy Luſts, or to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie

or to entertain a dumb Devill into his heart, not only to
hinder, but diſable him from either praying to the Lord

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57139:90"/>
the moſt of theſe devills ſome men and women are poſſeſſed,
and the moſt with ſome of them. 'Tis moſt certain that God
did not give mans ſoal brave wings to purſue the poor
quarrey of pleaſure, profit, and honour, or to fly unto hell,
but that by holy meditations, and a religious converſation
it ſhould with them mount up to Heaven. The Lord both
gives us our beings, and continueth us in them, to truſt, love,
ſerve, obey, honour, and delight in him. He hath aſſured
us we muſt dye, and yet concealed from us how long we
ſhall live, that ſo we might every day and every where expect

are making ready for it in our conception, our Birth is

love and ſalvation: when their Life is loſt and ended, all hope,

                        <p>O LORD, Man hath but one Door to let him into the
World by Life, but there are a thouſand Poſterns, Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
and Paſſages to let him out of it by Death. We are born
both Mortall and Miſerable; O give us bleſſed God ſo to live, that at
the end of our daies we may be immortally happy: we came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the World Sinners, O grant that we may go out of it Saints.
We were unclean at our birth, O let us be pure and holy at our
diſſolution. The hand of every moment winds off ſome of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
clue of Life. The ſtring and plummet of our daies creep, and
deſcend every minute nearer and nearer to the ground, our
Graves. The Sunne of this naturall Life never ſtands still, but
moves, or rather flies from the Eaſt and morning of our birth
and infancy, to the South, and noon of Youth, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and then haſtens to the Weſt, the evening of old Age.
Grant therefore holy God, that when this Sunne ſhall ſet in the
night of Death, our Soules may riſe and ſhine with the Sunne
of Righteouſneſſe in Glory; That as we grow older we may
grow holyer every day then other; That we may paſſe the
time of ſojourning in theſe Tents of fleſh in thy way and Fear,
that ſo the Conſcience, Evidence, and Comfort of a wel-ſpent
Life, may both Antidote and Arme us againſt the Sting and
Power of Death before it comes, and free us from the Horreus
and Miſery of it, when it doth come. O let it be no Stranger to
our thoughts, and then it will be no terrour to our Hearts. O
let us get death into our mindes, and that will put life into all
our Actions. O grant good God, that our Lives may
be pious, and then our Death will be peaceable, joyfull, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
unto us and precious in the ſight of the Lord. And give
us I beſeech thee moſt mercifull Father ſome cluſters of Grapes

                  <head>THE
CHARACTERS
OF A
True Beleever,
In PARADOXES,
AND
Seeming Contradictions.</head>
                  <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E beleeveth that which he cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
becauſe it is above reaſon. That
there are three diſtinct Perſons in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
yet but one God; that God is the
Father of Chriſt; that the Holy Ghoſt proceedeth from them
both, and yet that they are all three Coeternall and but
one in ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>2. He beleeveth that Chriſt who was before all time,
and created the world, was yet born in the fulneſſe of time,
and became man in the world. That he who fils both Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth, and can neither be included, nor excluded
any where, was ſhut up and confined within the narrow
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57139:98"/>
womb of a Virgin. That he who is the Omnipotent, and can
do whatever pleaſeth him, could neither go nor ſtand. That
he who is Wiſdome it ſelf, could not underſtand. That he
who is the Word, could not ſpeak. That Chriſt was killed
before he was alive, and ſlain before he was born. That he
who is Almighty, was held in the Arms, and bound in
the hands of a weak Woman. That the Mother of Chriſt
was both his Daughter, Creature, Spouſe, and a pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
even after her Son was born. And that if Jeſus had
not been ſlain for her from the beginning of the World,
<hi>Mary</hi> had not lived.</p>
                  <p>3. A true beleever is both a Pebble and a Diamond, a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and a Troubler of the World. He is both the honour and
ſcorn, the love, envy and hatred of men. In the Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
of the wicked he ſtandeth but for a Cypher, but in the
account of an holy God he is a Summe. In the ſcales of the
World he is droſſe, but in the Ballance of the Sanctuary
Gold.</p>
                  <p>4. A true Beleever is a merry mourner, one cheerfully
ſorrowfull. And as ſometimes the clouds and Sun do rain
and ſhine together: So while Rivers of penitent griefe and
tears ſpring up in his heart and run out at the floud-gates of
his eyes, celeſtiall beams of unknown joy, comfort, glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
dart upon, irradiate, and revive his dark, troubled,
drooping Spirit.</p>
                  <p>5. He riſeth by falling. Humiliation is his exaltation. He
goeth to Heaven by Hell. And is never ſo high and precious
in Gods eyes, as when he is vileſt and loweſt in his own.</p>
                  <p>6. A true Beleever is cured by ſickneſſe, being never ſo well
as when he fainteth &amp; is even ready to die of love for Chriſt.
Affliction is his phyſick, Julip, happineſſe. He is ſaved by
ſhip-wrack, landed by ſtormes, and deeply rooted by winds
and ſhakings.</p>
                  <p>7. He beeleveth God to be moſt juſt, and yet that the Lord
from all eternity decreed, that the innocent ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
and ſuffer to acquit the guilty: And alſo that the
greateſt ſinners ſhould be ſaved by one ſhould dye for ſin, and
yet never committed any ſin. He beleeveth himſelf to be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57139:98"/>
pardoned, and yet knows that a price was paid for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
worth more then ten thouſand Worlds. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves
God to be moſt mercifull, moſt loving, and yet knows,
that God delivered up his own, his only Son, and ſuffered
him to ſuffer not only the moſt bitter, painfull, and cruell,
but alſo the moſt ſhamefull Death. And likewiſe that the
Lord poured out upon him the fulleſt vials of his fierceſt
wrath, and that all this was done, endured, and ſuffered for
thoſe who were both Enemies and Traytors to God and his
Son.</p>
                  <p>8. A true Beleever hateth all the World, yet is no mans E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.
He is implacable, yet without malice; inexorable, yet
eaſy to be perſwaded. He prayeth for, and heartily forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
his very Murderers. His worſt enemies are friends to him
and do him good. He ſinneth leaſt, when he is moſt angry; Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
revenge on no body but himſelf; And never pleaſeth God
more then when he is moſt offended and diſpleaſed with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>9. A true Beleever is the moſt ambitious man in the World,
For nothing can ſatisfie or bound his aſpiring mind but a
Kingdome, and Crown, yet he is the moſt Loyall Subject and
the greateſt contemner of all ſublunary things. He wageth
and maintaineth with courage, reſolution, delight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
perpetuall Warrs, and yet he is the greateſt lover of
peace, lives in peace, is the moſt quiet man, and dies in peace.
He is victorious, yea invincible, yet fights without men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
both men and Devills. And though he be plundered,
beggered, and loſe all, yet he groweth rich and great by wars
without pay or pillage.</p>
                  <p>10. He is born both alive and dead. He dies twice, and
lives a threefold life of Nature, Grace, Glory. He hath one
reſurrection before another after he is dead.</p>
                  <p>11. He ſtudieth with delight and diligence to know that
which he is aſſured will both grieve and trouble him
being known. He is never ſo wiſe as when he knoweth
himſelf to be a Fool. He is never ſo likely to get ſafe to
ſhore, as when he is moſt fearful of being caſt away.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57139:99"/>
He is never beautifull untill he ſee, and acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be ugly, and deformed: and the more he loaths him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
the more God loves him.</p>
                  <p>12. He is born of mean and baſe Parents, and yet he is the
only truly noble Man: For he hath the Royalleſt bloud, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
alliances and relations, higheſt titles, choyceſt honours,
honourableſt Attendants, and the beſt eſtate of any man. For
God is his Father, Chriſt is his Husband, Heaven is his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
Saints are his Brethren, Angells are his Servants, and
Glory is his inheritance.</p>
                  <p>13. A true Beleever is born both a Begger and an Heir. He
often lives poor, yet is alwaies Rich, and dies wealthy, though
without Lands, money, goods. He keepeth his eſtate by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it away, and increaſeth it by ſpending of it, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
not only leſſen but loſe theirs by ſparing, and ſaving
it. And he taketh his treaſure with him to his Grave, and
beyond it.</p>
                  <p>14. He is never whole till he hath been broken. He is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
rightly, throughly cured until he hath been deeply woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
He is never on earth more really happy, then when he
ſeemeth to be truly miſerable. Injuries are favours to him;
loſſes, gain; calamities, mercies; afflictions, conſolations.
The breaking of his bones ſetteth them, and makes them both
ſtraight and ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>15. A true Beleever liveth in Heaven, whileſt he ſojourns
upon Earth, he ſpeaketh in company without being heard, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
anſwers which no man can either intercept, demurre,
or perceive, enjoyes the beſt company though alone. He walks
while he lies ſtill, and is not there where men behold
him.</p>
                  <p>16. He hath a continuall feaſt without fleſh, and eating: A
Banquet without ſweet meats, melody without muſick, and
Joy in the middeſt of ſorrow. He is dear, beloved, owned,
when he thinks himſelf deſpiſed, rejected, hated. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves
he ſhall find pleaſure in pain, honey in gal, life in death,
and doth ſo.</p>
                  <p>17. He hath all things in the midſt of his extreameſt wants,
yet is beholding to the World for nothing; for he fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57139:99"/>
his meat, drink, clothes, mercies, comforts and whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he poſſeſſeth from Heaven. He ſends by faithful, frequent,
fervent prayers to Chriſt for them, bids patience wait, and
appoints hope to bring him an anſwer, which believing he
ſhall receive, it cometh indeed either according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
and expectation, or beyond them. He alwaies ſpeeds and
obtains even when his ſuit is denyed. He hath what he will,
becauſe he will have but what he may, and therefore he ſits
down both contented and thankfull though he be croſſed.</p>
                  <p>18. A true Beleever is afraid of that which with zeal, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
ſincerity, and conſtancy he is reſolved to do, to ſerve
God. He delighteth in it, yet is grieved that he can perform
duty no better. He ſeeketh diligently for that which he
knows he ſhall not find, and beggeth that importunately
which he is aſſured will be both denyed and granted in this
world unto him. He is what he ſeems to be, yet is not what he
ſeems, being like <hi>Solomons</hi> Tents, black without, but ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with precious things within. He is both black and white,
weak and ſtrong, contemptible and Honourable, ſick and
well, at Liberty and in Priſon, a Sinner and a Saint, fearfull
and yet bold as a Lyon.</p>
                  <p>19. He leaves the dirty broad way of the World, and by
croſſing that, he goeth on directly in the right way toward
Heaven. Though he be far from home, and from his friends
in a ſtrange Countrey, yea in the darkeſt night, yet he can go
to his Father almoſt in a moment without wandring. Though
all the men in the World ſhould lye armed in Ambuſh to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
him, yet he can paſſe either ſafely by them, or victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
through them. For although he may be taken, or killed,
yet he cannot be kept or overcome.</p>
                  <p>20. A true Beleever loveth Gods Words and Ordinances as
dearly as his Life. Becauſe by them he was wounded to his
healing, humbled to his raiſing, inlightened to the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of his Blindneſſe, emptineſſe, nakedneſſe, nothingneſſe, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe,
and becauſe without them (though he had been the
ſole Monarch of the whole world) he had been everlaſtingly
undone, and a very begger. He trembles at the good, the
holy Word of God, yet both rejoyceth in it, and findeth
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57139:100"/>
tranſcendent ſweetneſſe, ſpiritual, yea ſoul-raviſhing joy and
gladneſſe by it.</p>
                  <p>21. He honoureth highly, loveth dearly, and obeyeth
willingly his naturall Parents, yet prizeth, and affects his
ſpirituall Father, a Godly Miniſter, above, and beyond all
men, though he be not at all akin to him: Becauſe he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that it's better never to be, then to be everlaſtingly miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and never to be Borne, then not to be Borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p>22. He will not, he dare not ſpare his own Flock, and
take anothers only Lamb. He therefore dedicates and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates
the Sabbath-day which is none of his own, wholly,
cheerfully, joyfully, thankfully, heartily, and religiouſly
to the Lord. And by ſo doing he getteth ſix for one to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
together with a promiſe of Gods guidance, favour,
protection, and bleſſing upon him, his, and his Labours in
his calling in them. And ſo by ſerving God he ſerves himſelf
too, and by giving God his due, he both keep's his own, and
getteth more then he had.</p>
                  <p>23. A true Beleever increaſeth his eſtate by giving it away,
gathereth by ſcattering. By clothing others he adorns
himſelf with Robes, by relieving others he ſupplies his
owne wants, and by ſowing Charity he reap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>24. He ſaveth his Life by confeſſing his guiltineſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
others condemn themſelves by concealing their crimes.
He's the only happy man, for nothing can make him miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Becauſe he is comforted when afflicted, he is at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in Bondage, at home when Baniſhed, ſed when fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed;
full though empty, ſatisfied when hungry, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
though degraded, ſafe when moſt cruelly perſecuted, and
when killed crowned.</p>
                  <p>25. He is naturally heavy and droffy, yet aſcends; and the
nearer his body comes to its Center, the earth, and its long
home, the Grave, by age and ſickneſſe, the faſter and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
his Soul mounts towards Heaven. And at length his Soul
is divorced from his Body, both with joy and griefe, exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and mourning.</p>
                  <p>26. A true Beleever is never ſatisfied, yet alwaies contented.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57139:100"/>
He feareth continually, yet ſeldome wants Hope. He doubts,
yet ſtedfaſtly beleeveth; he is not worldly minded, and yet
he is ſo covetous, that he never thinks he hath enough. He is
moſt temperate and ſober, yet is alwaies thirſty. He is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
Suiter, yet is reſolved to take no denyal. He knoweth

His motion is neither retrograde, nor circular, but progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,

that he is never quiet or pleaſed till it be mortified, crucified
and dead in him. He is both in the world, and out of it at
the ſame time. He is willing, yea deſirous to keep his eſtate,
yet freely parteth with it, if God will have it, and accounts
the loſſe of all for Chriſt, the greateſt, the trueſt gain.</p>
                  <p>28. He injoies that which he doubts he wants, loves unfain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
that which he feare he doth not care for, &amp; prizeth above
all things that which others trample under their feet. He is
aſſured of his Salvation, and that he is an Heir of Glory, yet
queſtions his evidences, and by<note n="*" place="margin">Nulla ſunt ſirmiora quam quae ex dubiis facta ſunt certa.</note> doubting makes them firm

                  <p>29. A true Beleever matters not his life, nay he deſires to

afraid of Hell and Damnation, yet would not knowingly
and with delight and perſeverance commit, or live in any

                  <p>30. He is diligent in his calling, yet doth not mind earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>31. That which others fear, flie and abhorre, he courts,
deſires, and welcomes. That which is their Funerall is his
Nuptials; For death doth not kill but tranſlate him, it doth

                  <p>40. The way for men to pleaſe God when he is offended, is

                  <p>46. His condition is very fearful that never feared his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion:
For their danger is certainly the greateſt, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was ſenſible of, nor affected with the greatneſſe of their
danger.</p>
                  <p>47. Every ſincerely pious Chriſtian find experimentally
that to be moſt true of God which <hi>Varius</hi> ſaid of <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
viz. That they who durſt ſpeak to him were ignorant of his
greatneſſe; and they who durſt not ſpeak to him,
were ignorant of his goodneſſe. He knows that the
Lord is Almighty and moſt dreadfull as well as moſt loving
and mercifull: he therefore comes into his preſence and prayes
unto him both with faith and fear, reverence and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
joy and trembling.</p>

he knows that the God of love, hates all ſin per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly.</p>
                  <p>49. Jeſus Chriſt never was nor ever will be either
precious or gracious to any, but thoſe only, to whom
all things in the World in reſpect of Chriſt are vile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.
The way then for Chriſtians to be liked, and
beloved of Chriſt, is to love and prize Chriſt above all
things, and to ſtrive to be like unto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>50. He to whom wickedneſſe is ſweet and but like cork
or feathers in this life, to him his moſt pleaſant Sins will
one day be bitter as gall, and the lighteſt, the leaſt of them
will then be found in finitely heavier then lead, milſtones, and
mountaines.</p>
                  <p>51. A Saints outſide is courſe and dark, but his inſide is
very rich and glorious. In the eyes of carnall men he is but
like an unpoliſhed Jewell, which to the ignorant ſeems no
better then a deſpicable ſtone. But in the ſight and account
of God, he is even then both amiable, orient and
precious. 'Tis better to be plain and pious, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and vitious. And to be beloved and honoured of God,
and hated and deſpiſed of the world, then to be beloved
and honoured of the world, and hated and deſpiſed of God,
who created the world.</p>
                  <p>52. He that is falſe and treacherous to himſelf, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be true or faithfull to another. He may really deſire
the goods of his friend, but he will never deſire really his
friends good. He will love a man till he needs him, but
when a man hath need of his love, he will rather betray then
beſtead him: Only he is a good friend that is really a good
Chriſtian. For piety is the right root of Amity, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
is the only ſpring of faithfulneſſe both to God and
man.</p>
                  <p>53. Nothing can ſatisfie the godly deſires of him that is
Gracious and heavenly, but the eternall fruition of that
gracious God in Heaven that gives him thoſe godly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>

in our ſelves, the faults we cenſure in others.</p>
                  <p>55. He that dares commit ſin without all fear of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but dares not profeſſe Chriſt for fear of diſgrace or
danger, is the verieſt, the maddeſt, the cruelleſt coward
in the world: and yet he dares do more then a Saint, who is
both bold as a Lyon, and the only true valiant man, for he
dares not knowingly, and willingly commit one ſin for
all the world.</p>
                  <p>56. He that will be of any Religion to pleaſe the Time he
lives in, will live in time to be of no Religion at all.</p>
                  <p>57. He that makes no Conſcience of being a dwarfe, will
quickly grow up to be a Gyant in wickedneſſe. For if his
face be not red with bluſhing at his whiſpering provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he will not be aſhamed, nor afraid, to die his ſoul ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
with loud-crying abominations.</p>
                  <p>58. Not only thoſe ſins that are of the firſt or ſecond mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude,
but even thoſe alſo that are of the leaſt ſize; are in
their own nature both great and mortall. <hi>Jaels</hi> nail will
kill as ſure as <hi>Goliahs</hi> Sword. A little halter will ſtrangle a
Felon as well as a Cable-roap. And 'tis well known that
little Boyes have often let in great Thieves to rob the houſe,
and murder the Maſter.</p>
                  <p>59. His heart cannot be good who never mourned under
the ſenſe and miſery of a bad, nor ſervently begg'd of God
that changes the heart, to have his heart changed, and to
give him the great mercy of a good heart.</p>
                  <p>60. His doings are well pleaſing to God, that is well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with Gods doings.</p>
                  <p>60. He was never athirſt for grace, that did not thirſt for
more grace then he had.</p>
                  <p>62. He that would have God to bleſſe him daily in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
muſt both have a cleer, a lawful calling to his calling,
and call daily upon God to bleſſe him, and his Labours in
it.</p>
                  <p>63. He that praies to God in anger, wrath, or malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
others, provokes God to wrath and anger by his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57139:105"/>
prayers. And in ſtead of prevailing with God for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe
of his treſpaſſes, he doth treſpaſſe yet more in asking
him for giveneſſe, becauſe he ſins willingly, even at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
time, when he ſeems earneſtly to beg of the Lord the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of his ſins, and ſo doth not pleaſe or ſerve, but mock
God. For the God of love and life doth infinitely hate, and
will not hear thoſe that love hatred, and live in it. But he
will avenge himſelf ſeverely upon all thoſe that deſire and
delight to revenge themſelves implacably upon others.</p>
                  <p>64. 'Tis midnight with an impenitent tranſgreſſor when he
hath the brighteſt noontide of proſperity; And 'tis a ſerene,
a ſhining Noontide with a Saint, when he is in the cloudieſt
midnight of adverſity.</p>
                  <p>65. A Saint is a great gainer, though he loſe all that he hath
in the world. But a wicked man is a great loſer, though he
gain all that the world hath in it.</p>
                  <p>66. He is mercifully cruell to his own Soul that ſpares the
lives of thoſe Amalekites his Sinnes. But he is both cruelly
merciful, and merciful without any cruelty to his ſoul, that
kils them all without mercy.</p>
                  <p>67. He that would live when he dies, muſt kill (by mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification)

                  <p>68. The ſins of others will increaſe his ſorrow, that doth
not ſorrow for others ſins.</p>
                  <p>69. He that would be married to Jeſus Chriſt, muſt get his
heart divorced from an inordinate love of worldly things,
becauſe Chriſt Jeſus will give him a Bill of Divorce that loves
the things of the world inordinately. For he that makes
earth his Heaven, or Paradiſe by ſuffering a ſinful love there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to enter into his Soul, his Soul ſhal never enter into the
Paradiſe of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>70. He that hath a ſaving intereſt in Chriſt, ſhall be full
and rich, even when he is empty, wantful, and deprived of
all creature-comforts: But he that wants a ſaving intereſt in
Chriſt, will be poor, and empty in the midſt of his fulleſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments

71. His Soul is ſick to death that neither is nor ever yet
was heart-ſick with grief for the ſins of his Life, which will
be (without true repentance) the death of his Soul: nor love
ſick for the great and good phyſitian of the ſoul Jeſus Chriſt,
who is both lovely and loving to thoſe only that are ſick of
love for him.</p>
                  <p>72. His ſins are moſt both odious and hainous that after
he hath repented of them, returns again with delight to the
commiſſion of his hainous ſinnes. Becauſe he hath laid God
in one, and put the Devill into the other Scale of the ballance,
and ſuffered the Devill to weigh down the Lord. He hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
heard God and the Devill argue and plead, and after a full
hearing he doth deliberately (by wilful relapſing) decree for
Satan againſt his Saviour. And ſo he doth both undervalue,
diſhonour and provoke God, and alſo repent that he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
God will therefore moſt certainly judge him for his
ſins without mercy that gives ſo ſinful a judgment againſt the
God of mercy.</p>
                  <p>73. It's reported that when <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaw M. <hi>Brutus</hi> come run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

And thou my ſon! The ſins of Gods Children do
grieve and offend Chriſt more then the iniquities of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
Becauſe a contempt, or an injury from a friend doth
both diſhonour him more highly, and wound him more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then an affront, or an abuſe from a profeſſed Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>74. He is a bad Magiſtrate that is not good for nothing.

                  <p>75. He that undermines the Church of God, doth at once
labour, ſweat, and weary himſelf to dig a hole down to
hel for his Soul to fall irrecoverably into the bottomleſſe
pit. And he that perſecutes the people of God, by ſhedding
their innocent, crying bloud, puls up a ſluce to let in a crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

                  <p>76. Never did any wicked men attempt to pull down God
from his Throne by ſetting up themſelves, their luſts, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57139:106"/>

                  <p>77. A pious Chriſtian, though he hates no mans perſon, is
yet the worſt, moſt inexorable, and invincible enemy of
all mortall creatures to the ungodly whoſe works and

diſpirit their ſtout hearts, blaſt their deſigns, wither
their flouriſhing hopes, to break the Arme of their power,
and to reſcue himſelf, and thoſe that fear God out of the

with the fading, dying, and killing glories of this
World, as for the Love of them to ſlight Heaven, neglect the
great Salvation offered them, and to reject Jeſus Chriſt,
their pomp will end in pain, their honour in Infamy, and
their Glory in eternal miſery.</p>
                  <p>80. He that ſlights, oppoſes, robs and wrongs the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours
of Jeſus Chriſt, Gods faithful Miniſters, doth diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
diſpleaſe, and bid defiance to their Maſter, the Lord

and ſubmiſſion) expect to receive neither peace, pardon,
nor quarter, but death without mercy, that ſteals from, or
fights againſt the God of bounty, Juſtice, and Mercy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
both the offers, and the offerers of peace.</p>
                  <p>81. He is an intollerable Traitor in and to a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
that hates, and perſecutes the Children of God. For
as it is Treaſon by the Laws of men, not only to murder a
Prince, but alſo to ſtab or malitiouſly to deface his picture;
So it is ſpirituall Rebellion too, not only to fight againſt
God himſelf, but alſo wilfully to wound, and to deſtroy
thoſe that bear his Image, his holy Servants.</p>
                  <p>82. He that would have his ſhamefull ſins for ever hidden,
muſt not be aſhamed, but reſolved to lay them open, and

But he that is rich and proſperous without Chriſt is really

and finally forſaken of God, muſt not only reſolve, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
endeavour both to depart from evil, and to do good.
For ſincerity is the root of couragious conſtancy, but Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie
is the true Mother of timerous Apoſtaſie. And it's
moſt certain, that he who will not leave his <hi>Rimmon,</hi> or
<hi>Mammon,</hi> his ſweet ſinne and his ſecret Luſt to pleaſe Chriſt,
will never loſe or lay down his Relations, Lands, Liberty,

whoſe power made it, whoſe Love prevailed with
him to let his own heart be pierced on the Croſſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock

to unbolt it, the arme of wrath will moſt certainly break
it to pieces. If the fire of infinite, unexpreſſible Love can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
melt it, the flames of endleſſe, intolerable Anger will
burn it. If the precious bloud of Chriſt do not ſoften this
